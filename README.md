# Movie Rating Analysis

This is a mini project from the EDX Python for Data Science course: https://www.edx.org/course/python-for-data-science

The dataset used for this analysis is from 
* Data Source: MovieLens web site (filename: ml-20m.zip)
* Location: https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/

The dataset used is above 100MiB. That's why it is not in this repo
